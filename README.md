# HTMLAssessment

### Description
This is an introductory HTML project designed to demonstrate foundational skills in HTML markup. The project involves creating a multi-section HTML document to showcase knowledge of HTML elements, attributes, and semantic structure. Each section contains specific tasks, such as working with text, tables, lists, and forms, which are integral to building well-structured web pages.

### Key Features
Text Section:
- Includes three paragraphs with the first word bolded.
- Formats the second paragraph as a block quotation with emphasis.

Table Section:
- Displays a game score table using colspan and rowspan attributes.
- Contains a header, footer, and caption to provide semantic clarity.

List Section:
- Organizes team information using an HTML list with default bullets.
- Adds links to team home pages and thumbnails of team logos.

Form Section:
- Collects user input via text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
- Includes a submit button and uses <br> tags for basic layout formatting.

### Technologies Used 
- HTML: Core technology for creating the structured document.
- Git/GitHub: For version control and collaborative project management.

### Lessons Learned
This project helped reinforce several essential web development concepts:

Semantic HTML:
- Ensuring the document is correctly structured using appropriate tags like <section>, <header>, <footer>, and <table>.

Attributes and Formatting:
- Applying attributes such as colspan, rowspan, href, alt, width, and height to enhance functionality and accessibility.

Media Embedding:
- Sourcing and embedding images using URLs while controlling dimensions for consistency.

Form Elements:
- Learning to use input types like text, radio, and checkboxes, as well as <select> for dropdowns.

Version Control:
- Using Git commands to initialize, commit, and push changes to a remote repository, ensuring proper version management.

### Future Improvements
- Incorporate CSS to improve the visual styling and layout of the document.
- Validate form inputs with JavaScript for better user experience.
- Add responsiveness to ensure the page renders well on different devices and screen sizes.
